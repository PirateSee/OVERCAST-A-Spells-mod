# OVERCAST - A SPELLS MOD

**BREAK THE LIMITS**

Adds some new spells into the game. Featured is the OVERCAST spell, which allows a wand to cast even if it doesn't have enough mana, but it wont be able to cast again until it fully replenishes its mana.
Also included, are a set of powerful Selection spells which
allow you to select entities and perform actions on them from any distance.

*selection spells in action*

Break the limits. Go discover the new spells! This mod has 44 spells (more to come soon) which can be helpful in wandbuilding for all stages in the game. From simple projectile spells to a brand new greek letter spell there should be something worth using.

Now adds some spells to starting wands!

NOTE: MAY BE INCOMPATABLE WITH SOME MODS EDITING gun.lua.
This mod appends to the gun.lua file to append to the draw_action and draw_actions functions. The old functions still get excuted, so it should have compatibilty. The OVERCAST spell which does this can be disabled in config if needed.
MUST LOAD *AFTER* Esoteric Arcana IF YOU WANT SPELLS/OPTIMISATIONS FROM BOTH MODS TO WORK!

UPDATE 1.2.0
The Alchemy Update!
Many spells involving materials and the world have been added, alongside 2 new materials!
