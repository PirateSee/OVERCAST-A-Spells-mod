New spells are added to possible spells found on starting wands. Two new wands can be found in the world, to unlock some new spells. There are even some secret new spells that might have something to do with rainbows...\n\nThe settings menu includes settings to disable appends to other files, in case of imcompatability issues. You may also disable any spell from this mod, removing it from the game.\n\nSome spell spotlights!\n\n[b]OVERCAST[/b]: The spell this mod is named after! This passive spell lets your wand cast, even if you don't have enough mana for it. You'll have to wait for your mana to fully recharge before casting again though.\n\n[b]Decaburst:[/b] Seen in the top right corner of the gif above, this spell shoots out 10 balls in every direction. After they come to a stop, they'll home in on your cursor.\n\n[b]Sentry:[/b] A floating crystal that'll cast the next 4 spells at the nearest enemy. Comes with an aiming laser!\n\nAnd of course, many more.\nHave fun! Try not to blow yourself up."
