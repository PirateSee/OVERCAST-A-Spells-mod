Featured is the OVERCAST spell, which allows a wand to cast even if it doesn't have enough mana, but it wont be able to cast again until it fully replenishes its mana.\nAlso included, are a set of powerful Selection spells which\nallow you to select entities and perform actions on them from any distance.\n\n[img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626173155681239052/1076256457810530425/noita-20230214-162702-1189672764-00011492.gif[/img]\n[selection spells in action]\n\nBreak the limits. Go discover the new spells! This mod has 44 spells (more to come soon) which can be helpful in wandbuilding for all stages in the game. From simple projectile spells to a brand new greek letter spell there should be something worth using.\n\n[img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626173155681239052/1081630439040614520/OVERCAST_multigif.gif[/img]\n\nNow adds some spells to starting wands!\n\nNOTE: MAY BE INCOMPATABLE WITH SOME MODS EDITING gun.lua.\nThis mod appends to the gun.lua file to append to the draw_action and draw_actions functions. The old functions still get excuted, so it should have compatibilty. The OVERCAST spell which does this can be disabled in config if needed.\nMUST LOAD *AFTER* [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2916164204]Esoteric Arcana[/url] IF YOU WANT SPELLS/OPTIMISATIONS FROM BOTH MODS TO WORK!\n\nUPDATE 1.2.0\nThe Alchemy Update!\nMany spells involving materials and the world have been added, alongside 2 new materials!\n\n[img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778778468041228298/1079120491786272789/noita-20230225-141646-1736004610-00005876.gif[/img]\n[Puddle Of Chaos being used with \n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2866701037]Chemical Curiosities[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2840072000]Graham's Things[/url] installed]"
